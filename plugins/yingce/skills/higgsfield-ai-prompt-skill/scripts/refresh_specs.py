"""Spec-drift tripwire — Wave C Tier 1 (item 5).

Turns the reactive 30-day staleness WARN in validate.py into a PROACTIVE check:
pull the live model catalog from the Higgsfield CLI, diff it against the
committed `specs/models_explore_snapshot_<date>.json`, and report drift loudly.

WHY THE CLI IS A DETECTOR, NOT A SOURCE OF TRUTH
  `higgsfield model get <id> --json` returns enum VALUES but no parameter
  `description` prose, and that prose is where sync_specs.py reads the
  cross-constraints ("4k only with mode='std'"). So this tool catches the
  high-value drift — new/removed models, enum-option changes (a `resolution`
  gaining `4k` IS visible), default changes, a tracked param vanishing — but it
  CANNOT see a pure cross-constraint prose change when enum membership holds.
  That blind spot is acknowledged and logged, never silently passed.

WHAT THE SELF-DIFF WATCHES (v3.37.0 — before this, only the OLD view's
params were walked and only enum+default were kept, so a NEW param such as
seedance_2_5 `start_image`, a range/type change, or a `required` flip exited 0
"Fresh" — 8 models gained params between the 08-07 baseline and 09-26 unseen):
  - models added / removed from the catalog
  - params ADDED (a media role such as `start_image` / `mask` is reported as a
    media-role change) and params gone
  - enum options, defaults, `type`, `required`, `min` / `max`
  - CEL constraint rules (`rules`)
  Views carry `"view": 2`; a pre-v3.37 baseline (no marker) is still read —
  type/required/min/max are compared only when BOTH sides carry them, so an
  old baseline never false-alarms on a channel it never recorded.

TWO-TIER MODEL
  Tier 1 (this script, headless): detect drift → tell you WHEN to refresh.
  Tier 2 (unchanged, interactive): a full `models_explore` dump → sync_specs.py,
  the only source with the constraint prose. Human-in-loop, as today.

  This script DETECTS ONLY — it never writes specs (beyond its own CLI
  baseline), never opens a PR, never edits the curated guides. When it reports a
  change, a human runs Tier 2.

DEFAULT MODE — CLI-baseline self-diff (the trustworthy tripwire)
  Compares the live CLI against a committed baseline of the LAST-ACCEPTED CLI
  surface (`specs/cli_baseline.json`). Both sides are the same source, so the
  result is pure change-over-time — immune to the CLI↔models_explore
  disagreements that make a snapshot-diff cry wolf (the CLI reports
  gpt_image_2=2k/high where models_explore says 1k/low; baked into the baseline
  once, that disagreement never re-alarms). Bootstrap with `--update-baseline`;
  after reviewing a change, accept it the same way.

  `--vs-snapshot` keeps the legacy mode (CLI vs the models_explore snapshot —
  "is my snapshot behind the live CLI?"), which is source-disagreement-prone.

3D MODELS
  The CLI has NO `model list --3d` flag (1.1.23: --image/--video/--audio/--text
  only). 3d rows are taken from the UNFILTERED `model list --json` by the row's
  own `type` field ("3d") — the CLI's classification, not a guess.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/refresh_specs.py --update-baseline   # bootstrap / accept current CLI
  python3 scripts/refresh_specs.py                      # self-diff vs baseline (default)
  python3 scripts/refresh_specs.py --type video         # one type (video|image|audio|3d)
  python3 scripts/refresh_specs.py --vs-snapshot        # legacy snapshot-diff
  python3 scripts/refresh_specs.py --json               # machine-readable diff
  python3 scripts/refresh_specs.py --status-json out.json   # CI: code/kind/line/remedy

Exit codes (the three states must stay distinguishable — a silent failure would
falsely read as "fresh", which is worse than the reactive WARN we already have):
  0  fresh — no change since baseline
  3  change detected — Tier 2 refresh + audit evals/cases/, then --update-baseline
  1  pull failed — the CLI could not answer. The failure is CLASSIFIED from the
     CLI's own stderr (kind=auth "Session expired" / kind=workspace "No
     workspace selected" / kind=missing-cli / kind=no-baseline / kind=empty —
     the CLI listed zero models of a type / kind=other) and the CLI line is
     carried through — REDACTED of anything that looks like an email, token or
     id, because CI posts it in a public issue — so CI names the right remedy
     instead of always blaming the credentials
  2  usage error
  4  CLI output shape changed — the CLI's JSON no longer matches what this script
     parses (e.g. the 1.0.1 `job_set_type`→`job_type` rename, a `rules: null`, a
     non-object payload); fix the parser, do NOT re-auth
  5  this script crashed (an unexpected Python exception — a local bug, not the
     CLI). Before v3.37.0 a crash exited 1 and read as "pull failed"

--update-baseline refuses an EMPTY pull (zero models of a type): accepting
it would make every later run "Fresh" against nothing. Each type's capture
date is kept in `captured_by_type` (a partial `--type video` re-capture no
longer re-dates the image/audio/3d views); `captured` is the OLDEST of them.
